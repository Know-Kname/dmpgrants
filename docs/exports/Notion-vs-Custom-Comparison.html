## Hybrid Approach (Recommended for Transition)

### Option 3: Start Custom, Use Notion for Grants

1. **Use Custom Software for:**
   - Work Orders

### Why This Works:
- Leverage strengths of both platforms
- Keep sensitive data in custom system
- Use Notion for collaborative, non-sensitive work
- Gradual transition as comfort grows
